This is a sample NextJS app directory webshop implementation.

`/endpoints` folder with BE endpoints was provided as is, checkout flow with `checkout/success` and `checkout/failure` were hard requirements.

There is no styling in the project, just sample business logic.

To run:

1. `npm run server`
2. `npm run dev`
3. go to `localhost:3000`
